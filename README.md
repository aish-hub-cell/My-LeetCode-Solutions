# Daily LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my daily LeetCode solutions. I solve random problems from LeetCode, and I upload the code for each solution here. Each solution will be added as a separate file with the problem name or the date of solving.

## How to Use:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Daily-LeetCode-Solutions.git
    cd Daily-LeetCode-Solutions
    ```

2. **Browse through solutions:**
    - Solutions are stored as individual files with the problem name or date in the filename (e.g., `two-sum.py` or `2025-04-13.py`).

3. **Run a solution:**
    - Navigate to the solution file for a given problem.
    - Run the Python solution for that problem:
    ```bash
    python solution.py
    ```

## Solution Format:
Each solution will contain:
- The problem-solving code (in Python).
- Comments inside the code explaining the approach.
- Time and space complexity analysis (if applicable) in the code comments.

## Why This Repository?

- **Track progress:** A simple way to track all the problems I've solved on LeetCode.
- **Learn by doing:** This helps me improve my problem-solving skills over time.
- **Improve coding:** Sharpening my coding skills with every problem I solve.
